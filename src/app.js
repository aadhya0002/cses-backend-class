//Setting up all Middlewares
//Middlewares are functions that have access to the request object (req), the response object (res), and the next middleware function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle.
//The next middleware function is commonly denoted by a variable named next.
//Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:
//Execute any code.
//Make changes to the request and the response objects.
//End the request-response cycle.
//Call the next middleware function in the stack.
// Middlewares are like a layer between the client and the server. They are used to perform operations on the request and response objects before sending them to the server or client.
